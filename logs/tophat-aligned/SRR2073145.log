[2022-04-11 22:09:03] Resuming TopHat pipeline with unmapped reads
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments

[2022-04-11 22:09:42] Searching for junctions via segment mapping
	Coverage-search algorithm is turned on, making this step very slow
	Please try running TopHat again with the option (--no-coverage-search) if this step takes too much time or memory.
